This folder contains notebooks to be used with IPython Notebook (Jupyter).

In these notebooks, KNN with K = 1 and K = 5 are used with the famous Iris dataset. Additionally, LogisticRegression is used against the Iris dataset.

In "silvaw_getting_started4.ipynb", we try KNN and LogisticRegression with the Iris dataset and get predictions for some sample data.

In "silvaw_getting_started5.ipynb", we try KNN and LogisticRegression again with the Iris dataset and get the training accuracy.
